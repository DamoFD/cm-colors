# Documentation Standards for `cm-colors`

Welcome to the documentation guidelines for the **cm-colors** library!  
Our goal is to make `cm-colors` accessible, understandable, and maintainable for users and contributors of all backgrounds.  
This guide outlines the standards and best practices for all documentation, whether you’re contributing code, guides, examples, or reference material.

---

## 1. **Core Principles**

- **Clarity:** Write for someone new to the project. Avoid jargon; define terms if used.
- **Accuracy:** Documentation must match the actual API/behavior. Update docs with code changes.
- **Accessibility:** Docs must be screen-reader friendly, have proper headings, alt text for images, and avoid color-only distinctions.
- **Completeness:** Cover all public APIs, features, and common usage scenarios.
- **Consistency:** Follow a uniform style and structure as described below.

---

## 2. **Required Documentation Sections**

Every major feature, API, or module should have documentation that includes:

### a. **Overview**
- What does this feature/module do?
- Why/when should someone use it?
- Example use cases.

### b. **Installation**
- How to install or import (npm, yarn, CDN, etc.).
- List minimum requirements (Node version, browser support, etc.).

### c. **Quick Start Example**
- Minimal working code snippet.
- Expected output or result (with screenshots or visual aids, if relevant).

### d. **API Reference**
- List all public functions, classes, types, and configuration options.
- For each:
  - Name and type signature
  - Parameters (with types and descriptions)
  - Return values (with types and descriptions)
  - Default values (if any)
  - Usage notes

### e. **Usage Guides & Recipes**
- Step-by-step guides for common tasks (e.g., “How to generate a color palette”).
- Best practices, limitations, and tips.
- Troubleshooting for common issues.

### f. **Accessibility Notes**
- Explain how to use `cm-colors` to support accessible design.
- List any accessibility limitations and workarounds.

### g. **Contribution Guide (for documentation)**
- How to suggest edits or improvements.
- Style and formatting requirements.
- Review/approval process.

## 3. **Formatting & Style**

- Use **Markdown** (`.md`) files.
- Headings: Use `#` for main titles, `##` for sections, `###` for subsections.
- Code: Use `fenced` code blocks (with language for syntax highlighting).
- Images: Use descriptive alt text.
- Links: Use full URLs or relative paths for internal docs.
- Lists: Use bullet points or numbers for steps.
- Tables: Use for option/parameter summaries where helpful.
- Language: Prefer simple, direct sentences. Use active voice.

---

## 4. **Accessibility Requirements**

- Every image must have meaningful alt text.
- Use semantic headings for easy navigation.
- Do not convey information by color alone—describe patterns, state, or meaning in text.
- Ensure docs can be read and navigated with a keyboard and screen reader (test with tools like NVDA, VoiceOver, or browser accessibility inspectors).

---

## 5. **Doc File Locations & Naming**

- User-facing guides: `guides/` (e.g., `guides/getting-started.md`, `guides/advanced-usage.md`)
- API Reference: `reference/` (e.g., `reference/palette.md`)
- Contribution and code docs: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `guides/documentation.md` (this file)
- Main project intro: `README.md`

---

## 6. **Review & Update Process**

- All docs must be reviewed before merging.
- Outdated docs must be flagged and updated with code changes.
- Major changes/additions should be proposed via pull request, with a summary of what was updated and why.
